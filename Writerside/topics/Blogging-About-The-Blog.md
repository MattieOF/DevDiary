# Blogging About The Blog

This site is a little different in that I've decided to present it using software designed for writing documentation.
I'd like to spend some time using this method and then evaluate to see how well it works compared to a traditional blog.
I expect that the lack of tags like a usual blog could be problematic for discoverability and the like, but we'll see!
