# Project 1: One Button Game

The first project! We were told to choose a partner and with them, make a game in 2 weeks. Though there was one limitation, and it's a big one: there can only be one input. 

Perhaps you could re-contextualise that input based on what was happening on the game, but only one physical input could actually affect the game. There were also some technicalities surrounding this: is both moving and clicking the mouse 1 or 2 inputs? The lecturers decided on it being two, so cookie clicker was out of the question.

Anyway, in [the next section](Idea-Generation.md) I'll talk about our basic design ideas, and after that I'll get stuck into talking about the technical details of the game.
