# Code Studio

_In this entry, I discuss the code studio module._

### Workshops

I came into the course with multiple years experience programming in C#, and 1 or 2 years in C++.
Therefore, most of what was covered in the workshops and lectures I had already learned through online resources
such as [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb).

Of course, you never know everything and so there were a few things I learned.
For example, I wasn't aware of the free store - I knew of the heap, but had never heard the term free store and was
unaware of the differences between the two. 

In the end, I often used the code studio time to work on other programming modules.

In the second year, where modules shift to topics which are completely new to me, such as programming for PS5s,
I will have to pay much closer attention to the material.
