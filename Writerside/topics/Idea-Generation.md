# Idea Generation

When we were given the project, we were told to team up with one other person, so I ended up teaming with the person sat next to me (who happened to an artist - perfect.)

We had some basic ideas: the first of which was a basic rhythm game. 
Pushing one button at the correct times is a surprisingly popular genre; for example, [Geometry Dash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Dash) 
practically only has one input, although it is re-contextualised depending on the movement mode the player is currently in.

The rhythm game seemed like a good idea, so we fleshed it out a little more by specifically making it specifically a fighting game.
And, for good measure, we threw in some cats. We discussed what art would be required, and I ensured my teammate that I would be able to make what we had designed. 
With that, we concluded our first - and what would end up being our last - design meeting.

Now it was time for me to make the game. First up, [choosing the engine](Engine-Selection.md).
