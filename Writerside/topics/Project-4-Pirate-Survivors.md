# Project 4: Pirate Survivors

### Programming for Designers
In conversation with the designers of this project, we found that we believe it is important that the project be coded in a way that functions as an API of sorts for designers to build on top off with more user-friendly solutions such as blueprints or the details panel.

With this in mind, I decided to design a system that would allow designers (and any team member for that matter) to create upgrades without code, and entirely new weapons solely in blueprint.

#### Architecture

Connect back to Proj 2

#### Asset Actions

Actor factories don't work if module is in wrong loading phase. Digging deep into Unreal Source discord.

#### Feedback

One piece of feedback received is that a simple typo in the property name could cause an error in the upgrade, which is a very easy mistake to make.
