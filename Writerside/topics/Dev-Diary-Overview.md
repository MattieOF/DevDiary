# Dev Diary Overview

Hello!
I'm **Matt Ware**, and this is my development diary. 
I'm a year one Games Technology student at the University of Portsmouth. 
On this blog, I'll document the trails and tribulations experienced during the development of both coursework projects, and projects taken on for.. _fun_ in my own time.

On the side, you can find a list of all projects and the related posts, neatly organised. 
Posts are ordered by project, not chronologically - but within those projects, the posts are ordered chronologically.
<!-- The date of writing each post should be included on each post (although this may not always be 100% accurate). -->

**Also, if you haven't already, I recommend turning on dark theme using the button in the top right.**
